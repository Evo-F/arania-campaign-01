In Session 0, we were introduced to The Party, consisting of:

- **Pamuk**, a Tabaxi Monk hailing from the southern reaches of [[Lampris]]. Pamuk works with the Maecia Crime Family to scratch out an honest living in a warm, rural, and somewhat underpopulated region. 
- **Mukagak**, a Half-Orc Barbarian. 
- **Darach Abelson**, a Human Artificer. 
- **{name pending}**, a Human Druid from the northernmost regions of [[Cretias]], even further north than the Elven stronghold of [[Al-Had]]. Spending most of his time in solitude, {name pending} has surely experienced a revelation or two from the stars, though he hasn't disclosed anything of the sort.

The Party are Initiates of [[The Librarians' Guild]] and are about to embark on a mission to scout various routes into and out of the hermit kingdom of [[Ch'ingua]], while surreptitiously collecting artifacts and lost literary works along the way. The mission is sure to be dangerous, but if successful, The Party is all but assured to achieve Acolyte status within the Guild.
