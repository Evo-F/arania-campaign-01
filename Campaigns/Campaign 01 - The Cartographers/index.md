title: Campaign - The Cartographers
---
This campaign follows the exploits of four wandering cartographers. The Party are Initiates of [[Groups/Guilds/The Librarians' Guild/index|The Librarians' Guild]] and are on a mission to scout various routes into and out of the hermit kingdom of [[Places/Ch'ingua/index|Ch'ingua]], while surreptitiously collecting artifacts and lost literary works along the way. The mission is sure to be dangerous, but if successful, The Party is all but assured to achieve Acolyte status within the Guild. 

The Party consists of:

- **Pamuk**, a Tabaxi Monk hailing from the southern reaches of [[Places/Lampris/index|Lampris]]. Pamuk works with the [[Maecia Crime Family]] to scratch out an honest living in a warm, rural, and somewhat underpopulated region. 
- **Mukagak**, a Half-Orc Barbarian. Mukagak is a follower of [[Hailoch]], the god of craftsmen, and seeks to understand what happened at the Ruined Obelisk.
- **Darach Abelson**, a Human Artificer born and raised in [[Old Barris]]. Armed with little else but a collection of writings and a musket of his father's design, Darach seeks to reunite with his father Abel, who left Darach's family when Darach was young. 
- **Isenbard**, a Human Druid from the northernmost regions of [[Places/Cretias/index|Cretias]], even further north than the Elven stronghold of [[Al-Had]]. Spending most of his time in solitude, Isenbard has surely experienced a revelation or two from the stars, though he hasn't disclosed anything of the sort.
- **Axton Therius**, a Human Wizard from the city of [[Carrin]], raised in the dark alleys of The Warren. Axton is a bright and inquisitive scribe, a natural fit for work at [[The Grand Library]], but the actions of an unscrupulous ancestor set him and his family on a much different path. Now, he seeks to redeem himself and his family name.
