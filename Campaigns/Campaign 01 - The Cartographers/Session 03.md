In Session 3, the Party had to make a decision on what to do about the wall surrounding the dead area. Initially deciding to go around the wall, the Party was interrupted by a Cretian Military patrol who appeared to pass right through the wall by the same method that Darach had opened it before. The Party decided to try to follow the patrol, under the assumption that they were either going somewhere within the dead area, or were on their way through it.

After two days of hiking, the Party came across a strange military fortress, which was identified on their maps as the Verny Garrison. Despite appearing as a typical military stronghold, the fortress was notable in that it appeared immune to the decay that plagued the surrounding land. From a nearby rise, Pamuk and Darach were able to observe green grass within the perimeter palisade wall. 

The Party decided to attempt entry into the fortress, and while narrowly avoiding a sentry patrol, they scaled the outer wall and entered the main fortress by an abandoned doorway. This led into a clearly unused corridor which the Party used to rest, safe from the plague.

Rested and alert, the Party continued their infiltration of the Garrison, with Isenbard temporarily shifting into a mouse in order to explore a nearby staircase. The staircase turned out to lead up to the officers' quarters, and following this revelation, the Party decided to explore further in search of an explanation or artifact that would get them through the area.
