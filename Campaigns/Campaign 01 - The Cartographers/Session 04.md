[[Session 03|Previous Session Notes]]

In Session 4, the Party was able to identify and infiltrate the Commandant's Office - later identified as Major General Thaddeus Groff.

Surprising for an officer of Groff's station, the quarters were plain and relatively unadorned, featuring only a [[Decree|framed notice]] declaring Groff's promotion and assignment to the Garrison in 201 5C. 

With Pamuk acting as lookout, the Party searched the room for any artifact that might allow them to pass through the plagued lands. Instead, they found 16 featureless metal cylinders, as well as a recently-opened [[Letter 03|letter]] on Groff's desk. Initially, the Party wanted to find Groff and force him to open the cylinders, assuming that they could only be opened by the authorized recipient. However, when Darach handled one of the cylinders, it mysteriously popped open and produced a document. Darach then proceeded to open all of the cylinders. 

[[Campaigns/Campaign 01 - The Cartographers/Session 04 Dossier/index|The documents]] gave the Party a wealth of intelligence, but the major takeaways were:
- The existence of a magical artifact called "The Fist" which is capable of absorbing energy and releasing it explosively. This process can sometimes cause rips in the Material Plane known as *aura voids*, which effectively act as permanent energy drains. 
- The Fist was first tested at Verny in 173 5C, levelling the city and ending the ongoing civil conflict there. This test created an aura void which is responsible for the plagued land surrounding the Garrison. 
- Darach's father, Abel Peterson, is alive and hiding on the island of Hailoch, in the small hamlet of [[Drayside]]. Prior to his disappearance in 201 5C, Abel had been working for the Cretian Military as part of something only known as the "P.D."
	- In addition to Abel being declared a traitor, Darach himself is wanted for questioning in connection with Abel's disappearance.
- Pamuk's crime family matriarch, Kedi Maecia, is actually a Cretian Military asset who has been surreptitiously using her syndicate to smuggle explosives into Ch'ingua in order to destabilize the nation. These explosives are derived from The Fist in some way, and have been refined such that they can be detonated remotely. 
- Isenbard himself appears to have previously been a Cretian Military asset, part of a confidential experiment to create an "arcane super-soldier" infused with the essence of The Fist. Although this experiment failed, Isenbard was returned to his home in the woods north of Al-Had with a false identity and memories implanted.

After narrowly escaping capture by the Cretian Military (and in Darach's case, surviving a 65-foot drop), the Party continued their march towards the ruins of Verny, reaching it after two days. Seeing footprints in the ash, the Party was able to find the rumored tunnel between Verny and Redmark, following it and resting about halfway through. It was observed that the tunnel seemed to pass right through the containment wall. 

At the Ch'inguan end of the tunnel, the Party emerged in the backroom of an unassuming merchant's shop, and were met by the proprietor of the establishment, Markos. Though at first a friendly and helpful gentleman, the Party was soon ambushed and captured by an unknown group of assailants. Having been blinded and knocked unconscious, it is unclear where the Party is being taken.
