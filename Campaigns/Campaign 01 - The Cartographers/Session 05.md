[[Session 04|Previous Session Notes]]

In Session 5, the Party found themselves bound and locked in a strange windowless room, seated at a table with a luxurious feast. The four Cartographers now found themselves in the company of an interloper, who introduced himself as **Axton Therius** - a scribe wizard hailing from [[Carrin]]. 

Shortly after, Markos entered the room, cloaked in scarlet. He introduced himself as a representative of the [[Red Star]], and indicated that they had been captured as ritual sacrifice to the god [[Barro]]. In keeping with established teachings and beliefs, they were to be fed and treated with great hospitality, and later could arm themselves as they saw fit before entering the arena. 

Isenbard took great offense to Markos' presence and was able to free himself from his binds before attempting to fight Markos. However, the man was able to dodge every blow aimed at him, simply bidding Isenbard sit down and listen to what he had to say.

Eventually, the Party was ushered out of the feast room and brought to the armory, where they were able to collect their personal affects before entering the arena. There, they were faced with five acolytes of the Red Star, each armed with various weapons. The Party was able to defeat the acolytes with ease, aided by Darach's newly-constructed Steel Guardian. Once victory had been achieved, the Party was able to leave the Red Star's underground commune, but Markos intercepted them as they reached the surface. 

Markos revealed that Darach's father, Abel Peterson, had previously fought and succeeded in the arena in much the same way Darach had - and similarly, Abel had refused membership in the cult, instead choosing to go on his way. Markos also revealed that Abel had passed through the commune not too long ago, seemingly in a hurry to reach the island of Hailoch. 

With this information, and now in the company of Axton Therius, the Party decided to journey west towards the port city of [[Kolir]]. From there, the Party intends to travel to Hailoch by ship.
