# PERSON OF INTEREST

# CONFIDENTIAL

**Subject Name:** Turear Ambermane
**Known Aliases:** None
**Status:** On Station, Frozen Waste
**Apprehension Orders:** Surveillance Only

## NOTES
- Turear Ambermane is the current leader of the P\[REDACTED] D\[REDACTED] and has been tasked with carrying on the work of former leader A. Peterson (ref. file #12553). 
- Ambermane is to be kept under close supervision and surveillance at all times under suspicion that he may be harboring anti-Cretias sentiment. 
- Ambermane was a close associate of A. Peterson during the latter's service. It is unclear if the two individuals still have any contact.
	- Any observed contact or other suspicious behavior is to be reported immediately. 

## BODY OF WORK
- Since the departure of A. Peterson, Ambermane has been chiefly responsible for research into the refinement and control of \[REDACTED] (ref. file #44089). 
- Ambermane is likely the single most knowledgeable individual on this subject, excluding A. Peterson (ref. file #12553). 

## ASSESSMENT
- It is believed that Ambermane is not a threat to national security and no longer has any connection to seditious elements. 
- Ambermane is motivated by perfecting his craft and, like many dwarves, seems apathetic towards the greater ramifications of his work.
- Given the necessary resources and freedom to pursue his work, it is our belief that Amberman will remain cooperative indefinitely and may retain his post as leader of the P\[REDACTED] D\[REDACTED].
