**Asset Name:** \[EXPUNGED]
**Known Aliases:** Isenbard
**Status:** Released / Uncontrolled (assessed non-threat)

## NOTES
- The individual presently known as Isenbard is a human male in his late 20s to early 30s.
- He was recovered from the forests surrounding the city of Al-Had and transported to the Frozen Waste. This was in pursuit of the creation of a so-called "arcane super-soldier" who could be imbued with the latent abilities of artifact PD-001 (ref. file #44089) for enhanced combat-effectiveness. 
- These efforts ultimately failed, resulting in the decision to close down the program and wipe the subject's memory. The subject was then implanted with false memories and a fabricated identity before being returned to his place of origin. 
- Because of the observed failure of the experiment and the efforts undertaken to wipe the individual's memory, there is at this time no surveillance effort focused on the individual. His whereabouts are unknown.

## ASSESSMENT
- It is our recommendation that efforts be made to establish surveillance on Isenbard. Although the relevant project was deemed a failure, it is still the case that the subject was exposed to high amounts of substance derived from PD-001, with no understanding of the long-term effects or ramifications thereof.
- It is also unclear if the efforts to wipe the subject's memory are truly permanent/irreversible. There remains a possibility that the subject's memories could be restored, thus compromising national security.
- As there has been some discussion regarding the re-establishment of the relevant project, it is our recommendation in that context that Isenbard be recovered by any means and taken into protective custody.
