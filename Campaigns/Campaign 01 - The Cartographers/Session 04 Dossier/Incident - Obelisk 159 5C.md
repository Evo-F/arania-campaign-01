# SOC CONFIDENTIAL

**Date of Incident:** 3 March 159 5C
**Description:** Discovery and accidental deployment of artifact designated PD-001 (ref. file #44089).

## DESCRIPTION
- On the 3rd of March 159 5C, a covert recovery team was performing a survey at the \[REDACTED] Obelisk near the Cretias-Lampris border. During this survey, one member of the recovery team identified and extracted a small stone later designated PD-001.
- The stone was observed to be warm to the touch, and was surrendered to the leader of the recovery team, Captain \[REDACTED]. This individual then inadvertently triggered the core behavior of PD-001, resulting in a sizeable explosion which significantly damaged the Obelisk and created a \[REDACTED] at the site. There were no known survivors.
	- At this time, the \[REDACTED] is contained.
- Throughout March 159 5C, several attempts were made to recover the stone as well as other artifacts extracted by the recovery team. The bodies of the recovery team were declared a total loss and no attempt was made at recovery.
- On 30 March 159 5C, the stone was successfully extracted using an experimental containment vessel devised by senior members of the P\[REDACTED] D\[REDACTED]. The stone was then transported to the Frozen Waste for analysis.
