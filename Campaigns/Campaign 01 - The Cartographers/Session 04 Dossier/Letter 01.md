High General:

We have received information related to the whereabouts of the traitor A.P. At this time it is believed that he is on the island of Hailoch. 

It is likely that he is being aided and abetted by the Lamprians. His presence in enemy territory represents a significant national security risk. 

It is my recommendation that we muster a task force at once to sail to Hailoch, investigate the validity of the information received, and apprehend the fugitive immediately.

Long Live Cretias, 

Major General T. Groff
Commandant of Verny Garrison
