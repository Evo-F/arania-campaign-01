[[Session 01|Previous Session Notes]]

In Session 2, the Party continued their southward trek from the city of [[Carrin]] towards the city of [[Verny]] and (hopefully) a passage into Ch'ingua. 

After two days on the road, the Party was attacked by three lightly-armed bandits, who turned out to be cultists of the [[Red Star]] with orders to prevent the Party from reaching Verny. One of the bandits held a note, reading:

```
Do what you must. They must not reach the city. The cat bears the stone.
```

As they were collecting themselves from the encounter, Darach received a message while handling the Greater Sending Stone:

```
Beware. Someone has given you up. Adversaries from all corners pursue you. Move with haste.
```

The Party increased their pace, and trekked for another seven days before reaching a 100-foot high wall, seemingly materialized out of nothing across their path.

After some experimentation, it was determined that Darach could open a door in the wall and somehow commune telepathically with it. With an open door in the wall, the Party proceeded through and was presented with an otherworldly and terrifying hellscape - a barren wasteland covered in ash, devoid of plant life or even rock outcroppings. Even the sky lacked color.

When the Party made camp, nobody got much sleep. Only Pamuk seemed well-rested, and Mukagak was so exhausted that he could only move at half his normal pace. The decision was made to retreat outside the wall and regroup.

Once outside the wall, Darach began studying the wall in depth, as he felt some sensation of familiarity with the intricate brickwork. Eventually, he had a breakthrough: he had seen these exact bricks as a young lad in his father's workshop. Paging through his father's old notes, Darach found an easily-missed note in the margins of a page:

```
Experiment self-replicating brick
- imbue the brick to replicate itself
- walls of immense size - defense of the plagued lands?
- other applications?
- *cannot* let PD find out
```

The true nature of the wall revealed, and with the threat of enemies unknown pursuing them, the Party plans their next move.
