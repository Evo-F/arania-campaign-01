title: Welcome to Arania
---
Welcome students, travelers, and all those who seek knowledge in all its forms!

This compendium of knowledge has been honorably curated by The Librarians' Guild with occasional (and reluctant) consultation with The Timekeepers. It is our earnest belief that this body of scholarly endeavor will serve you in your travels through this old and storied land. 

But take heed, pupil! This compendium is no mere *book* - indeed, it has been infused with subtle arcane magics which allow it to be modified from a great distance. Several scholars of The Grand Library are fully devoted to ensuring that this specific volume is constantly kept up-to-date with the most necessary and relevant information for your journey.

This particular page, the one you are reading right now, is the only page where we shall permit ourselves to editorialize. In our infinite humility, we will exercise restraint and avoid self-aggrandizing ourselves. Instead, we shall provide gentle recommendations for where you might like to begin your current perusal of this wondrous work.
