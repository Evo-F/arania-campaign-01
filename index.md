# Party Members
## Darach Abelson
- Human
- Level 5 Battlesmith Artificer
Darach Abelson is a human hailing from the Cretian town of Old Barris. When Darach was young, his father [[abel_peterson|Abel Peterson]] began to leave home for long periods of time before disappearing entirely five years ago. Darach has made it his mission to reunite with his father and learn the truth about his disappearance. 

Although holding no particular loyalties, Darach is committed to the values instilled in him by his father. He pursues goodness, equality, and humility in all things, and believes that technology (whether mundane or arcane) should always be used for good. 
- Joined the Party in Session 01.
## Isenbard
- Human
- Level 5 Circle of Stars Druid
Isenbard is a human from the cold tundra surrounding the Cretian city of Al-Had. Isenbard has had to fend for himself from a very young age, developing his survival skills in a hostile environment in total isolation. It is unclear when he began to develop his connection with the stars, but through his years of reflection and solitude he has developed magical druidic powers. 

On account of his long solitude, Isenbard lacks typical social graces and etiquette, often taking a blunt and inelegant approach to problem resolution. He is ruthlessly practical, believing that any entity which cannot take care of itself (whether that is an individual, an organization, or an entire kingdom) does not have an implicit right to exist. 
- Joined the Party in Session 01.
- Left the Party temporarily after Session 12, slated to return.
## Pamuk
- Tabaxi
- Level 5 Way of Shadow Monk

Pamuk is a Tabaxi monk, born in the southern reaches of Lampris. For most of his life, Pamuk has worked as a member of the Maecia Crime Family, one of any number of Lamprian crime syndicates specializing in smuggling. Pamuk has longstanding relationships with certain members of the Maecia family, most notably his handler, Ceylan Pompay. Through his work, he has also cultivated connections across all of Arania.

Pamuk is generally patient and practical, preferring to step back and gather as much information as possible before acting. Although he excels in martial combat on account of his feline dexterity, Pamuk is also reasonably intelligent, having studied in the *Historia* wing of The Grand Library prior to joining the Party. 
- Joined the Party in Session 01.
## Mukagak
- Half-Orc
- Level 5 Berserker Barbarian

Mukagak is a Half-Orc barbarian originating from a small town outside of [[Southreach]], in the hot Fell Desert of Lampris. Mukagak learned from a young age that he needed to be ruthless in order to survive, and so did whatever he could to hone his abilities as a warrior. Later in life, he sought favor with the god Hailoch. Mukagak first came to The Grand Library to do research on the Ruined Obelisk, but was hindered in this task by reading difficulties. Although it was not explicitly stated, [[historian_deimos|Historian Deimos]] dispatched Mukagak to accompany the Party mainly to provide some extra muscle.

Despite his large build and Orcish features, Mukagak is by all accounts a reasonable and pleasant person to be around, assuming you're not the target of his battleaxe. 
- Joined the Party in Session 01.
- Briefly left the Party at the end of Session 06, returned at start of Session 08.
- Became literate in Common in Session 11.

## Axton Therius
- Human
- Level 5 Scribe Wizard

Axton Therius the 16th is a human wizard from the city of Carrin, specifically the infamous neighborhood known as The Warren. Unlike the other members of the Party, Axton was not dispatched on this quest by The Grand Library, instead joining the Party incidentally when they were all kidnapped by the Red Star. 

One of Axton's ancestors was a member of The Librarians' Guild at the time of the Nightfall; instead of staying at the Library to defend it, according to his sworn oath, Axton's ancestor fled the Library. In doing this, he brought dishonor on his entire family, and for a time they had to leave Carrin for fear of persecution. In time, they returned to the city, though have endeavored to keep a low profile by living in The Warren. Axton believes that by completing a quest of great importance for The Grand Library, he will restore his family's reputation and atone for his ancestor's oathbreaking.

In addition to his arcane powers, Axton possesses a uniquely keen mind, granting him near-perfect recall of anything he has seen or heard. Though incredibly intelligent, Axton's commitment to redeeming his family has fostered an often-naive optimism. 
- Joined the Party in Session 05.

# Notable Exploits
## Infiltrating the Verny Garrison
In Sessions 03 and 04, the Party (minus Axton) infiltrated the Verny Garrison and escaped with a cache of confidential documents intended for the Garrison's commandant. Although their initial infiltration was reasonably covert, they were seen and identified during their escape.
## Crossing the Border
In Session 04, the Party (minus Axton) navigated the ruins of Verny and successfully crossed the border from Cretias into Ch'ingua.
## Passing the Crimson Sepulcher
In Session 05, the Party completed the trials of the Red Star, defeating a number of champions in the underground fighting ring known as the Crimson Sepulcher. For this, they were given the opportunity to join the Red Star and pledge their lives to Barro, though no one did. They were permitted to leave in peace and to never again be pursued by the cult.
## Liberating the City of Kolir
In Session 10, the Party fought and killed Lord Albus Cole, who had led his forces along with a contingent of the Cretian Military to occupy the Ch'inguan city of Kolir. As a result of Cole's death, the city was liberated and restored to the control of House Kolir. Although the Party was responsible for the city's freedom, they departed the city secretly and under cover of darkness; it is unclear to what extent their efforts are known.
