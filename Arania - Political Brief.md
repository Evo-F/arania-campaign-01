The continent of **Arania** is an old and storied land dominated by three nations: Cretias, Ch'ingua, and Lampris. These nations are generally at odds with one another but have not engaged in any open conflict for some time. 

**Cretias** is a military dictatorship, founded approximately two centuries ago relative to the present day. Prior to the foundation of this dictatorship, Cretias was two separate nations: the Eastern Union of Cretias, and the Western Republic of Cretias. In 12 5C, the Eastern Union of Cretias dissolved to form the *Cretian Protectorate*. The Cretian Protectorate invaded and annexed the Western Republic in 21 5C, officially ending the prolonged "cold war" and leading to the modern state of Cretias. Trade is heavily regulated and dissent is dealt with harshly, especially in the major cities; despite this, Cretias is generally prosperous and culturally advanced.

**Ch'ingua** is a hereditary monarchy, led by a king or queen (mostly kings) with absolute power. Ch'ingua is the oldest of the three nations and at one time governed the entirety of Arania. However, it is by far the most culturally regressed of the three nations, and was chiefly responsible for Arania's dark age, called the [[Nightfall]]. Although this dark age plagued the entirety of Arania, Ch'ingua by far suffered the most and has recovered the least. The Ch'inguan geography is harsh and unforgiving, forcing Ch'ingua to be heavily reliant on trade just for survival, despite an isolationist and jingoist foreign policy.

**Lampris** is a traditional republic. The country is divided into provinces, each with its own capital city alongside regional and local governments. Provinces send representatives to the national capital of Mend to pass laws and advise the president on policy. Despite the generally permissive and egalitarian culture, crime and corruption are rampant, and major cities are best avoided unless one has legitimate business there. In addition to its local government, major cities are generally headquarters for one of Lampris' many crime syndicates and organizations, each engaged in constant war for influence over one another. In Lampris, more than the other two nations, money talks.
