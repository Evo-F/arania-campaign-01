**Bastions** are player-owned bases of operation introduced in the 2024 edition of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* (5.5e/DnD 2024). Bastions have several unique characteristics, some of which are actually interesting and some of which are not. This page is an explanation of Evo's "default" rules for bastions, which includes some material taken directly from the 2024 DMG and some material that is modified or homebrewed.

By default, a bastion is owned and controlled by a single character. Bastions may be jointly owned and operated by agreement, but this is not a requirement. In the absence of such an agreement, only the bastion's owner can issue bastion commands.
# Acquisition
A bastion may be acquired in any number of ways, including purchase, conquest, or as a reward or gift. Bastions are comprised of the land itself, any and all structures on the land, and the space extending vertically in either direction for an indefinite distance. 

Structures of any size may be constructed on the owned land, but typically the land claim itself cannot be extended except through extraordinary means. 

If a character wants to establish a bastion from scratch on virgin land, they may do so starting at Level 5. 

# Bastion Turns and Commands
A bastion is not simply a place for the Party to congregate and plan their next move, though it can be indispensable for this purpose. Every 7 days of game time (or on a longer interval at DM's discretion), each bastion owned by a Party member will need to resolve one "bastion turn."

These turns represent the passing of time at a bastion, and may result in one or more effects on the owner, the owner's Party, or the bastion itself. 

Resolving a bastion turn involves the bastion's owner issuing one or more commands to their bastion and the Special Facilities within, processing one or more bastion events, or taking certain passive actions within the bastion itself (only available if the bastion's owner is physically present at the bastion). 

When a bastion is commanded to **maintain**, all hirelings and personnel within the bastion will direct their efforts towards keeping the bastion operating smoothly, and will take no particular actions beyond that. **Maintain** is an all-or-nothing command, and other commands cannot be issued to any Special Facilities alongside it. Issuing a **maintain** command will result in a random **bastion event**, rolled by the DM

If the bastion owner chooses not to **maintain**, separate commands must be issued to each Special Facility within the bastion. These commands are unique to each Special Facility and are detailed below.
# Bastion Treasury
The bastion maintains a secure treasury that may accrue or spend currency depending on a number of factors. The bastion's owner may also directly deposit or withdraw any amount of currency while they are present at the bastion. 

If the bastion's treasury reaches zero, the bastion will continue to operate as normal, but certain functions that require currency may be unavailable unless the bastion's owner is physically present to pay for them. 

The bastion's treasury is secure, and can only be accessed directly by the bastion's owner. 

The bastion's treasury is enchanted, and can convert denominations of currency according to the exchange rates set forth in the DMG. 

# Bastion Events
When a bastion is issued the **maintain** order, the DM rolls a d100 to determine the occurrence of a bastion event. Most of the time, the event will be "all is well", but certain events require additional effort to resolve.
## Attack
A hostile force attacks your bastion, but is defeated.

Roll `6d6`. For each die that rolls a 1, a bastion defender dies; if there are no remaining bastion defenders, a random Special Facility is damaged and forced to shut down, and the remaining rolls are ignored. 

A Special Facility that is damaged cannot be used on the next bastion turn, but will subsequently repair itself at no cost to you.
## Criminal Hireling
One of your bastion's hirelings has a criminal past, and someone has come to your bastion with a warrant. You may retain the hireling with a bribe of `1d6 x 100 GP`, otherwise the hireling is arrested and will be absent on your next bastion turn. A new hireling is subsequently retained at no cost to you. 
- A Special Facility with no hirelings cannot be used. 
## Extraordinary Opportunity
Your bastion has been presented with an extraordinary opportunity of some kind. 

If you seize the opportunity, you must pay 500 GP to cover costs, and the bastion receives a sudden influx of attention. The DM rolls again for another bastion event. Declining the opportunity has no effect.
## Friendly Visitors
Some friendly visitors arrive and seek the use of one of your Special Facilities. They offer `1d6 x 100 GP` for its use. Their use of the facility does not interfere with any other orders that have been issued.
## Guest
A friendly guest comes to stay at your bastion for some period of time. This may have some additional effects, determined by the nature of the guest.
## Lost Hirelings
One of your Special Facilities has lost its hirelings. The Special Facility cannot be used on your next bastion turn, but new hirelings are subsequently retained at no cost.
## Magical Discovery
Your hirelings discover (or accidentally create) an Uncommon magic item of your choice at no cost. The magic item must be a Potion or Scroll.
## Refugees
A group of `2d4` refugees seeks refuge at your bastion. If your bastion lacks a Basic Facility large enough to house them, they will camp right outside of your bastion. The refugees offer `1d6 x 100 GP` as payment for your hospitality. The refugees will stay until you find them a new home or a hostile force attacks your bastion.
- The refugees have bedrolls and do not require beds. Each refugee requires 25 square feet of floor space to sleep.
- The nature of the Basic Facility does not matter, and the refugees camping there will not interfere with its function. 
## Request for Aid
A local leader calls on your bastion for help. You must dispatch one or more of your bastion defenders, assuming you have any available. For each defender sent, roll `1d6`. 
- If the total is 10 or higher, the problem is resolved and you earn a reward of `1d6 x 100 GP`. 
- If the total is less than 10, the problem is still resolved, but the reward is halved post-roll and one of the dispatched defenders is killed. 
## Treasure
Your bastion has acquired a valuable item determined by rolling on the table below. You may claim the treasure immediately if you are in the bastion; otherwise, it is placed in storage.

| **1d100** | **Treasure**                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 01-40     | Roll on the 25 GP Art Objects table.                  |
| 41-63     | Roll on the 250 GP Art Objects table.                 |
| 64-73     | Roll on the 750 GP Art Objects table.                 |
| 74-75     | Roll on the 2500 GP Art Objects table.                |
| 76-90     | Roll on a Common Magic Items table of your choice.    |
| 91-98     | Roll on an Uncommon Magic Items table of your choice. |
| 99-00     | Roll on a Rare Magic Items table of your choice.      |

# Facilities
A bastion may be comprised of two kinds of facilities: Basic Facilities and Special Facilities. 
- Basic Facilities have no limitations and can be constructed at the owner's discretion for the appropriate price. Basic Facilities may also vary in size. 
- Special Facilities are unique, with a specific size that usually cannot be changed. Special Facilities can be acquired once the necessary prerequisites are achieved; there is no additional cost to construct them. 

Each facility can be one of three sizes: Cramped (100 square feet), Roomy (400 square feet), and Vast (900 square feet). The bastion's owner may pay an amount of gold to construct or upgrade a Basic Facility according to the desired size. 

| **Desired Size** | **Price to Construct** | **Price to Upgrade** | **Time to Construct** | **Time to Upgrade** |
| :--------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------: | :-----------------: |
|     Cramped      |         500 GP         |         N/A          |        20 days        |         N/A         |
|      Roomy       |        1000 GP         |        500 GP        |        45 days        |       25 days       |
|       Vast       |        3000 GP         |       2000 GP        |       125 days        |       80 days       |
## Basic Facilities
Basic Facilities are generic rooms which may or may not convey certain minor effects on either the bastion's owner or the bastion itself. When a bastion is first established, it comes with two Basic Facilities for free - one of size Roomy, and one of size Cramped. 

The type of Basic Facility constructed does not impact its price or construction time, and all Basic Facilities come pre-furnished. 

Numbers shown in parentheses like so (a/b/c) represent values when the facility is of size (Cramped/Roomy/Vast).

**Bedroom**
- Allows one character to Long Rest whenever they wish in this room.
- Bedrooms may be used by any character who is permitted to enter the bastion, not just the bastion's owner.

**Dining Room**
- Allows up to (4/8/12) characters to Short Rest for free, or Long Rest with a Kitchen of the same size or larger.

**Parlor**
- Accommodates up to (4/6/8) characters seated as well as (6/8/10) characters standing. 
- Seating may be omitted to allow an additional (6/10/14) characters standing.

**Courtyard**
- Stats identical to Parlor, but is outdoors. 

**Kitchen**
- Allows Long Rest in a Dining Room of equal or lesser size.

**Storage**
- Provides generic storage for a combined total of (2500/5000/10000) pounds of items. 

## Special Facilities
Special Facilities are unique rooms or stations with unique benefits affecting the bastion's owner, the owner's Party, and the bastion as a whole. Special Facilities have unique prerequisites and a minimum class level which must be achieved before they can be added to the bastion. Special Facilities are constructed for free, but are subject to construction times according to their size, detailed in the table above. 

Special Facilities also come with one or more **hirelings** who work in the facility and are responsible for maintaining it. Hirelings may be named or described at the discretion of the bastion's owner. Hirelings are sustained by the Special Facility they are a part of and do not need to be salaried; additionally, hirelings are loyal to the bastion's owner, and will never rebel or defy that person or their allies. 

If a Special Facility can be expanded (not all of them can), it cannot provide any benefit or receive any commands while it is being expanded. For time and currency costs associated with expansion, see the table above.

Unless otherwise specified, Special Facilities are unique and cannot be duplicated within a bastion.

Starting at level 5, characters may add two Special Facilities to their bastion. At level 9, they may add two more (total: 4). At level 13, they may add one more (total: 5). At level 17, they may add one more (total: 6). 
- Each time a character increases in level, they may replace one of their Special Facilities with another one for which they qualify. There is no cost associated with this change, but retrofitting the facility requires time. Refer to the table above for construction times; this operation is considered a "new construction" of the same size as the target Special Facility. 
- During the retrofit, neither the previous nor the new Special Facility will be available. 

Numbers shown in parentheses like so (a/b/c) represent values when the facility is of size (Cramped/Roomy/Vast). 

### Arcane Study
- Level: 5
- Prerequisite: Ability to use an Arcane Focus or tool as a Spellcasting Focus.
- Space: Roomy
- Hirelings: 1
- Unique: Yes

**Passive**
- After spending a Long Rest in your bastion, you gain a magical Charm that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. This Charm allows you to cast *Identify* without expending a spell slot or components. The Charm does not stack.

**Commands**
- Craft Arcane Focus - The facility's hireling crafts an Arcane Focus. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The Arcane Focus remains in the bastion until you claim it.
- Craft Book - The facility's hireling crafts a blank book. The work takes 7 days and costs 10 GP. 
- Craft Magic Item - Requires level 9+. The facility's hireling crafts a Common or Uncommon magic item according to the Arcana tables in chapter 7 of the DMG. The hireling has proficiency with the tool required to craft the item as well as proficiency in Arcana. The costs associated with crafting that item are applied here.
	- If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, the hireling may only assist in crafting it; the bastion's owner or other trusted party must craft the item themselves and have all the spells prepared every day spent crafting the item. 
### Archive
- Level: 13
- Prerequisite: None
- Space: Roomy
- Hirelings: 1
- Unique: Yes

**Passive**
- Your Archive has space for (0/2/4) rare and valuable reference books, and upon construction, one is granted to you for free. You may use the Study action on the book as long as both you and the book are present in the bastion, in order to derive a particular unique effect from it. This effect persists for 7 days or until used.
- You may only have a unique effect from one book at a time.
- Available reference books and their benefits are:
	- Bigby's Handy Arcana Codex - Advantage, Arcana.
	- The Chronepsis Chronicles - Advantage, History. 
	- Investigations of the Inquisitive - Advantage, Investigation.
	- Material Musings on the Nature of the World - Advantage, Nature.
	- The Old Faith and Other Religions - Advantage, Religion. 

**Commands**
- Research Helpful Lore - The facility's hireling searches the Archive for helpful lore. The work takes 7 days. The hireling gains knowledge as if they had cast *Legend Lore*, and shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them.
- Acquire New Book - The facility's hireling searches for a new reference book to add to the Archive's collection. The new reference book costs 1000 GP and takes `7 - 1d6` weeks to acquire, during which time a new command cannot be issued.
	- The 1000 GP is only deducted when the book is ultimately acquired, but if the money is not available at time of acquisition, the book is not acquired and the command is cancelled.
	- This command may be cancelled prior to completion, but doing so will not allow additional commands to be issued to the Archive on this turn.

**Expansion**
- Expands the Archive from Roomy to Vast.

### Armory
- Level: 5
- Prerequisite: None
- Space: Roomy
- Hirelings: 1
- Unique: Yes

**Passive**
- While the Armory is stocked, your bastion defenders are harder to kill; during a relevant bastion event, roll `1d8` in place of every `1d6` you would normally roll. 

**Commands**
- Stock Armory - The facility's hireling stocks the Armory with armor, shields, weapons, and ammunition. This takes 7 days and costs 100 GP plus an extra 100 GP for each bastion defender. The total cost is halved if your bastion has a Smithy.
	- Keep track of how many bastion defenders you have for each stock operation. If additional bastion defenders are recruited later, they will not benefit from the Armory's passive. 
	- You may also choose to overstock the armory in anticipation of future recruitment. 

### Barrack
- Level: 5
- Prerequisite: None
- Space: Roomy
- Hirelings: 1
- Unique: No

**Passive**
- Provides living quarters for up to (0/12/25) bastion defenders.

### Demiplane
- Level: 17
- Prerequisite: Identical to Arcane Study. 
- Space: Vast
- Hirelings: 1
- Unique: Yes

*The Demiplane exists in an extradimensional space and therefore is not attached physically to the bastion and occupies no physical space. The Demiplane is accessed by a magical door that is 10 feet tall and up to 5 feet wide, appearing on a flat, solid surface in one of the other facilities within the bastion. The door can be relocated during a bastion turn if you are present in the bastion.*

**Passive**
- While in the Demiplane, you can take a Magic action to create a nonmagical object of your choice out of nothing. The object must be no larger than 5 feet in any dimension, may not have a value over 5 GP, and must be made of: wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or nonprecious metal. This action can only be taken once per Long Rest. 
- The item may be taken out of the Demiplane through the door.

**Commands**
