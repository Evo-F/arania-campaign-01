title: Session 08

As the sun rose on a new day, the Party finally reached their goal: the Ch'inguan city of Kolir. They found the city bounded on all sides by mountainous and unforgiving terrain, and before them stood a single fortified gate through the city's walls.

The Party found the gate guarded not by Ch'inguan sentries, but by soldiers of the Cretian Military, the same ones they had encountered previously on the road. There was now no question of the dire circumstances: Kolir was under foreign occupation.

The Party deliberated, and ultimately hatched a plan to gain entrance to the city. Given that the soldiers were from Cretias, it was possible that the Party's affiliation with The Grand Library might give them some sway in entering the city. Isenbard took the lead in these negotiations, speaking face-to-face with the head guard and presenting him with the Peepee Book, as proof of the Party's allegiance. As luck would have it, the guard had great respect for historians and other men-of-learning, and so was inclined to give the Party access to the city if they could answer one question: did their allegiances truly align with Cretias?

Here, it was not Isenbard, but the barbarian Mukagak who uttered a hearty agreement, convincing the soldiers that the Party could be trusted. With this, the gate was raised, and they were allowed into the city.

On the surface, Kolir appeared to be a conventional city, apart from a definite presence of soldiers patrolling the streets amongst the crowds. But the Party was not here to people-watch - the point of coming to Kolir was to acquire a boat and travel to the island of Hailoch. Naturally, the first stop was to be Kolir's legendary harbor. 

Upon their arrival, the Party was faced with an improbable sight: there were no boats at all in the harbor. Even worse, the entrance to the harbor was blockaded by Cretian warships. Their plan had encountered some complications. A ways down the harborwalk, the Party encountered an old man, who seemed to be gazing at the abandoned harbor in quiet reflection.

Pamuk spoke with the man, trying to obtain whatever knowledge he might have. The man, as it turned out, was more than happy to volunteer his wisdom to five strangers, sharing with them a brief history of the city and surprisingly expressing some rebellious attitudes. The Koliri people, he indicated, were not satisfied with their current state of occupation; in his words, "This city is a powder keg, and it just needs the right spark."

Before he walked on, the man told the Party that he was aware of a private harbor, secretly located beneath the Kolir Citadel connected through a concealed tunnel to the main harbor. Because of its secrecy, this private harbor was only accessible from the Lord's Chamber at the very top of the Citadel.

The Party decided to spend some time staking out the harbor, under the assumption that the blockade ships must have to make port at some point to collect supplies and rotate personnel. After some hours, and just before the sun set below the horizon, the Party witnessed a new ship join the blockade, sailing slowly alongside the warships on a deliberate bearing. Pamuk's keen eyes were able to just barely make out the motions of each warship transferring supplies and crewmen with the passing ship, and Isenbard was able to identify what was going on: the blockade was performing **underway replenishment**, and the warships were likely at anchor with no intent on ever making port. 

With this revelation, the Party turned in for the night at the local inn, and at daybreak decided to split up to survey the city individually.

Darach and Mukagak went to search the city for arms and armor.

Isenbard observed the movements of the rats in the city, noticing that they seemed to congregate and make their burrows under the Citadel or in its vicinity.

Pamuk waited silently in the inn, listening to the local populace to determine sentiment. The overheard conversations largely confirmed what the old man at the harbor had said - the people were not happy with their occupiers, and there were whispers of smuggling and stockpiling weapons into the city.

Axton observed the patrol routes of the occupying soldiers, noticing that they seemed to stay on the main roads and areas of high civilian activity. He then sent his raven familiar to the top of the citadel, where he caught a glimpse of the man sitting on the throne in the Lord's Chamber: Lord Albus Cole. Before the familiar could escape, it was spotted by Cole, and destroyed with an eldritch blast from his hand.
