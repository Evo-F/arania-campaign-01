title: Session 12

The Party is now on their third day in Drayside. Following their initial dismissal by Abel, the Party spent some time exploring the village and determining what might be constructed there. Each member of the Party was assigned a house, and orders were issued for the construction of several special facilities. 

Around midday, the Party was summoned to Abel's villa. In addition to Abel and his servant from earlier in the week, the Party was introduced to [[primus|Primus]], the first automaton that Abel ever constructed. Unlike the other automatons, Primus is able to experience some level of emotion, though it is unclear why. It is possible that Primus is special in some way, having been the "prototype" automaton of Abel's design. It is also possible that Primus developed these emotions organically on account of his age. 

Once everyone was introduced, Abel offered to answer any questions the Party may have. Once their questions had been answered, Abel began his briefing, conjuring a projection of a red gem in the middle of the table. This was The Fist, the mystical artifact that Abel had been tasked with researching and harnessing during his time working with the Cretian Military.

The Fist has the unique and terrifying ability to absorb energy directly from the Plane in which it resides. Although theoretically it could absorb energy from other Planes, this had not been observed or tested. There is no known limit as to how much energy The Fist can absorb, and although this energy could be released in any form and at any rate, no one has yet been able to wield it successfully. Instead, The Fist is liable to release all of its energy at once in an immense fiery shockwave, destroying everything around it with the curious exception of the wielder.

If it has absorbed enough energy, The Fist is capable of creating a wound in the Plane itself - Abel referred to this wound as an "aura void." The aura void functions almost like a drain in a basin, constantly absorbing planar energy and effectively draining the life from whatever is around it. This drain happens slow enough that its effects are only noticeable on the land itself or on creatures that dwell near an aura void for some time; simply passing through an affected landscape would not do any permanent damage. However, within a drained area, the very nature of the Plane is disrupted - it becomes impossible for any creature to rest, and magic can behave in wild and unpredictable ways. 

There is no way to "cure" an aura void, and although measures have been devised to contain one, it is not clear if those measures are permanent. Given enough time, an aura void is liable to drain the energy of an entire world. 

Here, the Party is introduced to Abel's former superior and now High General of Cretias, [[lionel_arric|Lionel Arric]]. High General Arric is obsessed with achieving dominion over all of Arania, and seeks to use every tool at his disposal including The Fist in pursuit of this goal. He does not care about the damage he could do to the Material Plane, nor does he care about any other ramifications of his actions, so long as he achieves victory. Moreover, Arric is not the only one who would see Cretias rule over all of Arania, and in the decades since assuming the position of High General, he has built a near-impenetrable cult of personality. Arric's ambition cannot be countered through subterfuge or cunning; he must be challenged directly, and the Party is not yet ready.

In the short-term, it is clear that the Cretian Military is no longer inclined to sit idle behind their borders, as demonstrated by their occupation of Kolir. This means that the whole of Arania is now in imminent danger; there is no more time. Efforts to stop Arric must begin immediately.

In this regard, the Party is presented with their first task: to unify the fragmented and feuding noble houses of Ch'ingua, allowing them to act as a united front to repel any Cretian incursions. Although Ch'ingua is a monarchy, the monarch requires the cooperation and loyalty of the Major Houses; their rule is not necessarily absolute. In the past, the Royal House was able to enforce this loyalty through military might, but following the Succession Crisis 200 years ago, the power of the present Royal House is seriously diminished. The Party therefore must find a way to convince the five Major Houses and the Royal House to cooperate of their own free will. 

Following the conclusion of Abel's briefing, the Party devised a plan: rather than convincing the Major Houses to cooperate with each other, they would try to convince the Major Houses to cooperate with the Party themselves. In this way, they might be able to establish a stronger united front without exacerbating existing tensions. The Party elected to begin their quest in the city of Kolir - following their role in the city's liberation, they might have better luck achieving an audience with whoever is now in power. 

Meanwhile, Isenbard elected go north to the Frozen Waste, the site of the Cretian Military's secret research facility where Abel worked for decades. Using his powers of Wild Shape and his ability to survive in the wilderness, he intends to gather whatever information he can about the true nature of The Fist and how the Cretian Military may intend to use it.
