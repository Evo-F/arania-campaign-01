title: Session 06

In Session 6, the Party continued their journey eastward towards the city of Kolir. As they followed the highway towards the city and learned more about their new colleague, Axton Therius, they came across an empty cave. Within the cave, they found the corpse of a long-dead scholar, dating back to the time of the Nightfall. The Party was able to recover some supplies and writings off the poor scholar's body. 

Upon leaving the cave, the Party was ambushed by a group of five bandits, who they were able to dispatch with relative ease.

Continuing further down the road, and with the sun setting behind them, the Party encountered an open shelter, bearing an inscription honoring the god Zenus, patron of travelers. The Party rested there and restocked on provisions, and the next day once again set out towards Kolir. However, just a short distance down the road, they encountered an unexpected sight: a Cretian Military patrol. 

The patrol consisted only of two soldiers, but each soldier had a weapon eerily similar to Darach's musket, and similar to the weapons borne by the soldiers at Verny Garrison. One of the soldiers was killed outright, but the Party took the opportunity to interrogate the other soldier once he had been defeated. After much persuasion, the soldier told them about a military encampment set up as a checkpoint further up the road; the soldier further advised the Party that they were outnumbered and would certainly die if they challenged the camp. 

Armed with this new knowledge, the Party continued on.
