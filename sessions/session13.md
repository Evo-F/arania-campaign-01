title: Session 13

At the start of Session 13, the Party departed Drayside bound for the city of Kolir. They sought an audience with the new Lord of Kolir, in the hopes that he would be amenable to their plans to establish a new freehold to combat the Cretian imperialists.

Upon reaching Kolir, the Party found the city in much higher spirits than their last visit. The city gates were open and the people milled about the streets with a renewed energy and purpose. Before proceeding to the Citadel, the Party decided it would be wise to ascertain exactly *who* had taken control of the city since its liberation. 

Pamuk took the lead in this effort, conducting a lewd display in the market square with the hopes of making contact with the Tabaxi smugglers. Sure enough, Pamuk was soon ushered into an alley and found himself face-to-face with the same Tabaxi who had intercepted him on their last visit. Pamuk ascertained that House Kolir had regained control of the city following the defeat of House Cole and the Cretian Military, and that as the city's liberators, the Party was in a unique position to seek an audience with Lord Kolir.

The Party approached the gates of the Citadel, and after producing Lord Cole's terrifying mace as evidence of their triumph, they were able to proceed up to the throne room. Seated on the throne of Kolir was none other than the old man they had met in the harbor during their last visit, now introduced to them as Lord Dain Kolir. Following their introductions, the Party was informed by Lord Kolir that Albus Cole's body was never recovered, and they had assumed that he had fled the city entirely. Lord Kolir seemed troubled and disturbed by the revelation that the Party had in fact *killed* Albus Cole, and it seemed as though this revelation confirmed some suspicions that Lord Kolir already held.

Regardless, the meeting continued, with Lord Kolir asking the Party plainly what their business was in the city. Here, Pamuk took the lead, explaining in great detail their plan to establish a united freehold of cities and towns in the hopes of repelling a Cretian invasion. The Party handed over their recovered documents from the Verny Garrison as evidence that the Cretian Military posed a legitimate threat not just to Arania, but potentially the entire Material Plane. 

Pamuk spoke passionately and eloquently to sway Lord Kolir, pointing out that none of the other Major Houses or the Royal House itself had come to the city's aid when it was invaded. Kolir is a vibrant and prosperous place, and in Pamuk's view, the city is being held back by its affiliation with Ch'ingua - a nation that has by all accounts become a failed state, loosely held together by little more than ancient tradition. 

Lord Kolir took heed of Pamuk's words, and after some time reflecting, declared that his priority was to his city and his people, and the future of Kolir must be apart from Ch'ingua. With this action, Kolir has officially seceded from Ch'ingua and joined the Freehold. 

From here, the Party plots their next move.
