title: Session 07

During Session 7, the Party completed the final leg of their journey towards Kolir. Without their trusty Mukagak, the Party had to remain especially vigilant and cautious, knowing that their odds in combat would not be favorable.

As they neared the city, the Party encountered a fortified checkpoint on the road, just as the captured soldier had warned them about. Through focused observation, the Party was able to determine that the camp was populated by eight soldiers - they were thoroughly outnumbered.

After some deliberation, the decision was made to attempt a diversion and to evade the camp altogether. Darach commanded his Steel Defender to create a distraction, running in the opposite direction of the city in the hopes of raising the alarm at the camp and drawing some soldiers away. During this diversion, the Party snuck around the camp on its south side, and as they ran further down the road, Axton was grazed in the leg by what was unmistakably a musket ball. 

After a moment to heal the wound, the Party continued down the road, prepared to reach Kolir by daybreak.
