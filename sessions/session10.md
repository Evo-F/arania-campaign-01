title: Session 10

After a night spent waiting in the alley, the Party has had enough. It is clear that Albus Cole is not coming down from the Citadel to deal with the rioting civilians, and at this point, the guards are beginning to establish a foothold around what used to be the gate. The Party thus decided that if they were to challenge Cole, they would need to storm the Citadel themselves, and they would need to do so immediately. 

Once inside, the Party was faced with an interminable spiral staircase up the center of the Citadel. Darach dispatched his Steel Defender to scout the staircase and determine that it led to the Citadel's throne room. Once they received confirmation (in the form of two large stones falling to the ground), the Party proceeded up the stairs, and confronted Albus Cole in his throne room.

Despite his advanced age, Albus Cole was a formidable presence, wielding a horrifying mace that looked as though it could harm through sheer malice. The Party fought valiantly and ultimately defeated Cole, finding a stash of treasure and highly-valuable alcohol. Axton briefly donned the Crown of Kolir, granting him the power to open the secret passage to the underground harbor. The Crown itself was left behind on the throne.

Following the passage down, the Party eventually came to the harbor - really, an unremarkable dock in a cave hewn beneath the cliffs. Moored at the dock was a small sailing vessel, which Axton was able to communicate with through his mind, likely due to his brief contact with the Crown of Kolir. The vessel was thus commanded to sail for Drayside, and as they exited the cave into the dusk, they witnessed the Cretian armada abandoning the blockade, and fireworks bursting over the city of Kolir behind them.
