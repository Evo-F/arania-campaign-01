Following his investigations, Pamuk managed to establish contact with a ring of Tabaxi smugglers operating in Kolir. The Party was invited to attend a meeting at a secure location in the northern part of Kolir. 

The Party learned that these smugglers were working to incite a civil uprising in Kolir, taking advantage of local discontent over the city's occupation. Over the past weeks, the smugglers had been working to discretely arm the citizens of Kolir, and had also managed to procure a single large barrel of smokepowder - a highly volatile and explosive substance. Despite their newfound armaments, the citizens of Kolir are afraid to spontaneously rise up and fight the Cretian occupiers; the soldiers have strange weaponry that has the potential to do serious damage in a fight. The Koliri easily outnumber their occupiers, but they must be rallied to act. 

With this information, the Party devised a plan. Isenbard would transform into a draft animal while Pamuk turned him invisible. He would then transport the barrel of smokepowder directly in front of the gates of the Kolir Citadel, then quickly escape before the guards could learn what had occurred. Mukagak would then detonate the barrel from afar by throwing an improvised smokepowder grenade, and the resulting blast would decimate the defending force and utterly destroy the gates.

The next evening, the plan was put into action. The barrel was detonated thanks to a skillful grenade throw from Mukagak, and the contingent of guards at the Citadel gates were utterly destroyed. The blast was enough to rouse the Koliri populace, and within moments it seemed as though the entire city was in open rebellion.

Taking a moment to consider the tactical ramifications of charging into the Citadel, the Party instead retreated to a nearby alley, while the civilian mob closed in on the Citadel and the few remaining guards there. It was clear to the Party that any route out of Kolir had to go through its overlord, Albus Cole, so it was decided that they would wait for him to come out of the Citadel himself.
