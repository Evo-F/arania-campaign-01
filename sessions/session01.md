title: Session 01

In Session 1, the Party received their mandate from [[Historian Deimos]], the eccentric Guildsman in charge of the *Historia* wing of The Grand Library. Deimos instructed the Party that they are to infiltrate the hermit kingdom of Ch'ingua, document their entry and exit routes, collect any literary works or artifacts they may find along the way, and return "without causing an international incident" (i.e. bloodless clause). 

*"It is better that you would lay down your own lives before taking another's."* -Deimos

Deimos informed the Party of three potential overland routes into Ch'ingua:
- An underground tunnel connecting Verny with Redmark.
- An indirect overland route which passes by the Wandering Spire in Lampris before ending at Rabbiton. 
- A seemingly direct route by the eastern coast which crosses the border into Dawngate.

Deimos then left the Party in his office, but not before presenting them with a rucksack containing the following items:
- A blank parchment book (the "Peepee Book") and an ink fountain pen. 
- Fifty (50) silver pieces.
- A strange stone which is determined to be a **Greater Sending Stone.**

The Party chose to depart on the overland route towards Verny, following the main highway at least as far as the Verny Garrison.

While walking towards the Southern Gate, on the road between The Warren and Buxton, the Party encountered an old woman begging for spare change. Pamuk gave the woman 10 silver, but Isenbard rebuffed the woman harshly. At this, the woman drew a knife and attacked the Party, but a swift blow from Pamuk knocked the woman to the ground and left her unconscious (but definitely still alive). The Party reclaimed the 10 silver previously given to the woman. 

At the Southern Gate, the Party was accosted by the Captain of the Southways Guard, along with six other guards. They inform the Party that there is a fee to exit the city through their gate, and that the Party must produce 150 silver pieces. 

Darach Abelson devised a plan to dance the Party's way out of trouble, and performed an elaborate performance involving tearing and replacing pages out of the Peepee Book, and casting a firebolt straight through his beloved hat. The other guards were amazed, and the Captain allowed the Party to proceed out of sheer exasperation. 

The Party received eight (8) silver pieces and twenty-five (25) gold pieces from various guards as a tribute for Darach's incredible performance.

With that, the four adventurers began their two-week journey over land towards Verny and (hopefully) the kingdom of Ch'ingua.
