What follows is an accurate and faultless account of the known history of the land known as Arania, made in collaboration with The Timekeepers and The Librarians' Guild. 

At present, The Timekeepers hold that is the **206th Year of the 5th Cycle**.

# 1st Cycle
- Lorum ipsum.

# 2nd Cycle
- Lorum ipsum.

# 3rd Cycle
- Lorum ipsum.

# 4th Cycle (1114 Years)
- 902
	- [[Yarbus Ossetius]] decrees the closure of all institutions of learning, ushering in what is now known as the [[Nightfall]]. The Nightfall lasts for the remainder of the 4th Cycle.
	- The royal army of Ch'ingua attempts to sack [[The Grand Library]] of [[Carrin]], finding it mostly empty. All members of [[The Librarians' Guild]] are escorted from the library and executed. 
- 911
	- King Yarbus of Ch'ingua survives an assassination attempt. 
- 930
	- The royal court in [[Stonehall]] declares the death of King Yarbus and the ascension of his son, Lysander, to the throne of Ch'ingua. He is crowned King Lysander II. 
- 989
	- [[Ariana I]] is crowned the first queen of Ch'ingua since the 3rd Cycle. She rules for 64 years and is considered by most to be a notably just and reasoned queen. 
- 1113
	- King Crallus III of Ch'ingua dies after just three months on the throne, creating a power vacuum due to his lack of any heirs (even illegitimate ones). Following a period of brief civil conflict, House Margrave declares themselves the rightful rulers of Ch'ingua and crown Michael I as king.

- 1114
	- King Michael I of Ch'ingua revokes the [[Royal Decree on the Seditious Nature of Scholars and Scholarship]]. This effectively ends the Nightfall, and The Timekeepers declare this momentous occasion as the end of the 4th Cycle.

# 5th Cycle (Present)
- 161
	- *See [[The Verny Conflict]]*.
