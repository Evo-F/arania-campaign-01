# Summary
Guildmaster Eirros (former surname unknown) is a Half-Elf scholar of [[The Grand Library]]. Not much is known about the Guildmaster, apart from how long he has been a member of the guild - 72 years, with 21 of those years serving as Guildmaster. 

Eirros' scholarly specialty is Philosophy, granting him the honorific of "Orator." Although scholarly domains have no impact on positions within the Guilld, Eirros is the first Orator Guildmaster since the 3rd Cycle. 

It is believed that Eirros is not originally from Arania at all, but from another land or potentially another plane entirely. It is the judgment of the Guild at this time that this is highly unlikely.
