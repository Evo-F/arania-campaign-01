# Summary
Lok's Town was a small village of about 200 citizens, located approximately half a day's ride south-southeast of [[Barristow]]. It was sacked by a group of soldiers claiming to represent the [[Free Barristow Movement]] in the year 186 5C; during this event, almost all citizens of the town were executed, and the survivors assimilated into the FBM with their identities concealed. 

Because of its dark and painful history, Lok's Town has not been resettled and is abandoned. Many in the region consider it to be cursed, and will go to great lengths to avoid even passing through it. 

Prior to its abandonment, Lok's Town primarily served as a stopping point for those travelling along the main highway which ran through it. It hosted a sizeable inn for a town of its size, as well as a general goods store. 

The people of Lok's Town were largely subsistence farmers, raising cattle, sheep, and other livestock as well as growing a number of crops including corn.
