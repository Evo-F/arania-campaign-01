# Description
The Grand Library is a massive multi-floored library complex located in the coastal city of [[Carrin]]. It is considered the intellectual center of all of Arania, and boasts a number of rare and impressive works. Some works exist solely in The Grand Library, and scholars and students the world over make the journey to Carrin to study these works.

The Grand Library's main structure is rectangular, encircling a large central courtyard. In total, there are five primary sections or "wings" of the library - four wings concerning particular subject areas, and the Grand Archives.

The Grand Library is open at all times, and throughout its entire history, has only ever been truly inaccessible a handful of times.

# The Librarians' Guild
The Grand Library is home to the illustrious [[Librarians Guild|Librarians' Guild]], a group of scholars who are also trained in combat. The guildsmen are sworn to protect The Grand Library with their lives, and are similarly sworn to assist anyone who comes to the library seeking knowledge in good faith. 

Because of their oath, there must always be a guildsman guarding the door to the library, regardless of circumstances. 

# Wings
## Wing 1 | Histories
The original purpose of the library was to house and secure a vast number of historical accounts and records, regardless of their authority. Wing 1 is the oldest wing of the library, and was originally the only one constructed. The main entrance to The Grand Library comes through Wing 1. 

Of all the wings of The Grand Library, Wing 1 most resembles a "traditional" library, with various areas and corners littered with study rooms, desks, and long tables lit with candles. 

## Wing 2 | Practica
The second wing is The Practical Sciences Wing, and is devoted to the advancement of crafts and handiwork. Wing 2 was constructed at the direct request of the Governor of Carrin at some point in the 3rd Cycle, as it was decided that there needed to be a place of training and scholarship for those who worked with their hands more than their minds. 

Wing 2 is equipped with several forges and smithing facilities, a vast assortment of tools (both common and exotic), and an impressive repository of materials ranging from metals to gemstones.

## Wing 3 | Philosophy
The third wing of The Grand Library is devoted not just to Philosophy, but any works related to thought, reasoning, rhetoric, and opinion. Wing 3 was commissioned by the [[Academy of Orators and Philosophers]], who desired a scholarly home for the refinement of their craft.

The Philosophy Wing is the most extravagant of the four wings, and features countless lecture halls and spaces resembling traditional classrooms. 

## Wing 4 | Arcaneum
The fourth wing of The Grand Library is called The Arcaneum, and is devoted to the study and advancement of the magic and other mystic arts. 

The Arcaneum is the only main wing of The Grand Library to which access is restricted - the resident mages are very selective on who can access their secrets and engage with their studies. In order to enter The Arcaneum, you will be asked to demonstrate your proficiency in the mystic arts, but this proficiency test is different for each person and cannot be prepared for.

In addition to a considerable volume of spellbooks, scrolls, and arcane reference books, The Arcaneum also boasts a number of workstations and tools related to the more practical arts of enchanting and spellcrafting. There are also practice rooms for those who are so inclined to practice their magics and refine their craft.

## Wing 5 | The Grand Archives
The fifth and final wing of The Grand Library is not really a wing at all, but a massive and cavernous complex stretching out beneath the structure of the library. When news reached Carrin that an inquisition was coming to ransack The Grand Library during the [[Nightfall]], the local scholars and mages shifted the entire body of work housed there into the caverns below, sealing the entryway and enchanting it with a very basic protection spell. When the inquisitors arrived, the scholars were taken away from The Grand Library, but the archived works remained secure and hidden. 

Eventually the Nightfall ended and a new generation of scholars came to tend The Grand Library. The cache beneath the library remained undisturbed for nearly two centuries and the works contained within them were believed lost - this "New Guild" was prepared to start from scratch and build an entirely new corpus. However, a magical accident early in the 5th Cycle knocked out the protection charm and caused the rocks to shift. As a result, the scholars uncovered the treasure trove of lost works and declared the caverns beneath the library as the fifth wing: The Grand Archives.

To this day, The Grand Archives are extensively maintained and closely guarded. Only those who have devoted their lives to the service of The Grand Library are granted access. Those seeking scholarship held within the Archives must be accompanied by a Guildsman or Elder Guildsman at all times. Unauthorized access to The Grand Archives is punishable by death.
