# Description
The nation of Ch'ingua holds dominion over the southwestern portion of Arania.

The capital of Ch'ingua is [[Stonehall]].

# Government
Ch'ingua is a traditional monarchist state, ruled by a king or queen with absolute power. The role of king or queen is a hereditary office passed according to the rules of male primogeniture (the eldest son inherits the crown, or the eldest daughter if there are no sons). 

The current Ch'inguan Royal Family is **House Margrave** since they seized power from House Ossetius in 1113 4C, following the death of King Crallus I "The Brief" Ossetius. 

The Ch'inguan Royal Family has been House Ossetius since they led a successful revolt against the previous royal family, House Dire, in 56 4C. 

# Noble Houses
In addition to the royal family, the daily affairs of Ch'ingua are overseen in a mock feudalistic manner, with various portions of the nation being under the control of different noble houses. These noble houses possess their own armies, resources, and supply chains, though on paper they all swear fealty to the Royal House. 

The noble houses of Ch'ingua are split between **major** houses, which typically hold sway over larger tracts of land or entire cities, and **minor** houses which have smaller holdings and traditionally swear fealty to some major house. The Royal House always holds the [[Marches of Stonehall]] and the city itself.
