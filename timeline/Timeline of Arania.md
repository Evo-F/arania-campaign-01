What follows is an accurate and faultless account of the known history of the land known as Arania, made in collaboration with The Timekeepers and The Librarians' Guild. 

At present, The Timekeepers hold that is the **206th Year of the 5th Cycle**.

# 1st Cycle
- The Timekeepers have not sanctioned any events to be recorded here at this time.

# 2nd Cycle
- The Timekeepers have not sanctioned any events to be recorded here at this time.

# 3rd Cycle (833 Years)
- 554
	- The city of [[Carrin]] enters a period of significant growth and expansion. 

# 4th Cycle (1114 Years)
- 843
	- The city of [[Carrin]] creates the ward of **East Carrin**. 
- 902
	- [[Yarbus Ossetius|King Yarbus of Ch'ingua]] decrees the closure of all institutions of learning and the prosecution of practitioners thereof.
		- *See [[Nightfall]].*
		- *See [[Royal Decree on the Seditious Nature of Scholars and Scholarship]].*
- 911
	- King Yarbus of Ch'ingua survives an assassination attempt. Two more follow in the coming months.
- 930
	- The royal court in [[Stonehall]] declares the death of King Yarbus and the ascension of his son, Lysander, to the throne of Ch'ingua. He is crowned King Lysander II. 
- 989
	- [[Ariana I]] is crowned the first queen of Ch'ingua since the 3rd Cycle. She rules for 64 years and is considered by most to be a notably just and reasoned queen. 
- 1113
	- King Crallus III of Ch'ingua dies after just three months on the throne, creating a power vacuum due to his lack of any heirs (even illegitimate ones). Following a period of brief civil conflict, House Margrave declares themselves the rightful rulers of Ch'ingua and crown Michael I as king. 
		- *See [[1113_succession_crisis|Succession Crisis of 1113 4C]]*. 
- 1114
	- King Michael I of Ch'ingua revokes the [[Royal Decree on the Seditious Nature of Scholars and Scholarship]]. This effectively ends the Nightfall, and The Timekeepers declare this momentous occasion as the end of the 4th Cycle.

# 5th Cycle (Present)
- 12
	- A military coup dissolves the Eastern Union of Cretias and forms the Cretian Protectorate.

		- *See [[Foundation of Modern Cretias]]*

	- An incident of unknown origin disrupts the protection charm surrounding [[The Grand Library]], resulting in the discovery of a massive cache of works previously believed lost during the Nightfall period.
