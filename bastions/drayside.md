title: Bastion - Drayside
---
In Session 11, The Cartographers received authority over the village of Drayside and its automaton inhabitants. The village was established as a Bastion under Evo's amended Bastion ruleset, which can be referred to [[bastions|here]]. 

# Description
Drayside is a village located at the base of Mount Dray on its west side. The village extends from a small dock in the west to the slopes of Mount Dray in the east. 

Unlike a typical bastion, the facilities in Drayside take the form of individual buildings which may be connected or merged at the Party's discretion. Unless otherwise specified, each facility is its own distinct physical structure.
