title: Bottle of Marisi Rum, 750mL, 155 5C Vintage
---
This is a 750mL bottle of Marisi Rum. According to the label, it was bottled in the year 155 5C. The Party recovered this bottle from Albus Cole's trove during [[session10|Session 10]]. 

It is said that Marisi Rum is the most valuable liquid by volume in all of Arania. At this vintage, this particular bottle could be sold for around 5000 GP. 
- Because Marisi Rum is outlawed in Ch'ingua as a stipulation of the Barristow Accords, it is likely worth far more; however, potential buyers will need to be okay with acquiring contraband.
