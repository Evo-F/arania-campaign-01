# Description
Kolir is a port city on the western coast of Ch'ingua. Kolir is one of the younger cities of Ch'ingua, tracing its roots only as far back as the 3rd Cycle while most Ch'inguan cities trace back to the 1st or 2nd. Despite its age, Kolir is considered the most prosperous city in Ch'ingua, second only to the capital city of [[Stonehall]]. 

Kolir is controlled by [[House Kolir]], a Ch'inguan royal house that has held fiefdom over the city since its founding. 

# History
Historians disagree on the exact date that Kolir was founded, however it is known that the city was considered a regional capital by the year 4C 509, according to records recovered in the Grand Archives. 

Although generally a prosperous and well-regarded city (similar to [[Carrin]]), Kolir also has a storied history of localized civil unrest. Although House Kolir has always been in charge of the city, the city's administrator has been unseated by force no fewer than eight times throughout its history. Kolir frequently experiences workers' strikes, typically from various subsets of dockworkers.

As befits a city of its stature, Kolir has also been subject to several repeated attempts at annexation and occupation, typically from other Ch'inguan noble houses. The most recent attempt occurred during the [[Succession Crisis of 1113 4C]] when House Aran unsuccessfully attempted to seize the city in an early bid for power following the death of King Crallus III. Aided by House Mynham, House Kolir was able to repel the armies of House Aran and withstand a minor siege.
