# Summary
It is possible for characters in certain conditions to acquire a **Planar Spell Slot**. This is a special spell slot that allows for either casting a "traditional" spell with certain unavoidable side effects, or casting a unique Planar spell that the character knows. 

Characters may only ever have one **Planar Spell Slot**, and the spell slot is lost upon a Long Rest. Refer to [[Energy Siphoning]] for details on acquiring a Planar Spell Slot.
# Casting Traditional Spells with PSS
A character may cast any known spell using their **Planar Spell Slot** in place of a traditional spell slot. In this case, the spell will behave as though cast with a spell slot of one level higher than the Planar Spell Slot used - for example, if a 5th Level Planar Spell Slot is used to cast a spell, that spell will behave as though it was cast at 6th Level. 
- 9th Level spells cast in this fashion will only ever behave as if cast at 9th Level. 

Additionally, the caster will experience unavoidable side effects according to the spell's School.
## Abjuration
- The caster's skin is hardened and calcified by the empowered magic, halving the caster's movement speed while also providing the effects of Stoneskin.
- This effect lasts for 10 turns. 
## Conjuration
- TODO
## Divination
- All creatures within 15 feet of the caster experience the following effect, which is called Fortune's Confluence:
	- All "bonus dice" (Luck, Bardic Inspiration, etc.) are expended and rolled immediately, their results recorded in the order they were rolled.
	- Each creature affected by Fortune's Confluence must take the result from the top of the list as a bonus to their next applicable roll (Attack, Spellcasting, Saving Throw, etc.). This result is then removed from the list. 
## Enchantment
- In addition to the chosen spell, the caster also casts Confusion centered on themselves. Confusion is cast at the same level as the chosen spell, and does not consume a spell slot. The caster is not subject to Concentration checks for this spell.
## Evocation
- The caster takes `2d8` damage of the same type dealt by the spell. 
	- If the spell does not deal any damage, the caster takes `2d8` magic damage. 
	- If the spell deals multiple types of damage, the damage type used is the one that deals the greatest damage from the spell. 
## Illusion
- Illusion spells are cast at 2 levels above the Planar Spell Slot used (instead of the usual 1). However, their duration is halved. 
- If applicable, targeted creatures automatically fail Saving Throws against Illusion spells cast in this manner. 
## Necromancy
- TODO
## Transmutation
