The Succession Crisis of 1113 4C was a period of brief civil unrest in the nation of [[Ch'ingua]] following the death of King Crallus III "The Brief" of House Ossetius. This period concluded with [[House Margrave]] declaring themselves as the Ch'inguan Royal House uncontested and the crowning of King Michael I "The Usurper." 

# Origins
In early 1113 4C, Crallus III is crowned as king of Ch'ingua following the death of his father, King Perseus II. Crallus was the only son of Perseus and was known from birth for being sickly and generally weak. As a result, Crallus himself died only three months into his reign, accomplishing nothing of note and siring no heirs legitimate or otherwise.

# Power Vacuum
Ch'inguan royal succession follows the rules of **male primogeniture** - this means that, upon the death of the monarch, the crown passes to their eldest male child, only passing to the eldest female child if there are no eligible males. In the case of Crallus, this meant that the crown simply had nowhere to go - further complicating matters was Crallus' lack of siblings. 

Within days of Crallus' death, several Major Houses of Ch'ingua had already rallied their armies and begun aggressively consolidating power. Within weeks, Ch'ingua was engulfed in open war, as civil authority had all but dissolved in the absence of a monarch. Nearly all of the Minor Houses of Ch'ingua aligned themselves with various Major Houses in the hopes of elevating their own status following the war. 

# Open Warfare
There is some debate as to what the Succession Crisis truly constitutes in Ch'inguan history, whether it was merely a period of unrest and political turmoil or whether it was a proper civil war. There is no denying that several major houses did engage in open armed conflict with one another. 

The crisis saw several notable battles. The first major skirmish was the Battle of Kolir, a successful defense of the city of [[Kolir]] by the armies of House Kolir aligned with House Mynham. The city was attacked by House Aran in an early bid to secure a second regional seat. Another major battle, and one considered the "turning point" of the war, was the capture of Fralia by a combined force of House Margrave and [[House Cole]]. In exchange for their service, House Margrave elevated House Cole to a Major House following the ascension of Michael I, giving them the regional seat of Fralia.
