[[Session 10|Previous Session Notes]]

After nearly a full day of sailing, the Party arrived in the village of Drayside. Immediately, something about the village seemed strange - apart from a notably large villa on the opposite side of the village, there seemed to be no structures aside from private residences. There were no shops, no temples, no artisan facilities, not even an inn or tavern. Pamuk elected to scout the city and perhaps extract some useful information from the citizens, while the rest of the Party remained by the boat.

During his scouting, Pamuk observed increasingly strange behavior from the citizens. None of them seemed capable or willing to speak to him, though they did at least acknowledge him as he walked through the streets. At one point, Pamuk violently accosted a civilian, and after a brief loss of consciousness, the civilian got up and walked away as though nothing had happened. 

Meanwhile, back at the boat, Darach took the opportunity to flip through his father's notes, and scrawled into the margins he found precisely the answer they were looking for: it seemed like the citizens of Drayside were **artificial humanoids**, most likely constructed by Abel Peterson. After sharing the information with Pamuk upon his return, the Party came to an undeniable conclusion: Abel was in Drayside.

The most obvious place to look was the villa on the other side of town, so the Party set out to reach it. The front door of the villa was locked, but appeared to magically open of its own accord when Darach touched it. After idling in the villa's foyer, the Party was met by a domestic servant, clearly another of Abel's artificial humanoids. The servant brought them to the villa's second floor and down a long series of corridors, to a room that turned out to be Abel's own workshop.

After years of silence, the reunion between Darach and his father was tense. Darach understandably harbored great resentment towards Abel for his apparent abandonment his family, but Abel seemed unwilling to acknowledge this anger, resolute in his opinion that he did the right thing. Choosing not to linger on the subject, Abel provided the Party with an explanation of where he had gone and what he knew about the artifact known as The Fist - a powerful magical item with the power to destroy the Material Plane itself, now in the hands of the Cretian Military.

Abel dismissed the Party, explaining that he had work to do but would brief them more fully on the situation in the coming days. Before they left the workshop, Abel examined Mukagak's eyes and provided him with a set of enchanted glasses. These glasses not only corrected Mukagak's eyesight (which had been deficient for so long he had not realized it), but also granted him literacy in the Common tongue. Abel also granted the Party authority over the entire village of Drayside and its inhabitants.
