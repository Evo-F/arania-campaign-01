Across Arania, there are **ten** supernatural and omnipotent beings which are variously worshipped as gods. 

It is important to note the following points regarding these gods:
- No god is considered superior to any others.
- Some gods require **exclusivity** before they will bestow any kind of blessing on their faithful, which is to say that a follower must devote themselves fully to that god and no others (this is usually through some kind of initiation ritual or participation in a cult). Conversely, some gods can bestow blessings and boons on just about anybody if they so desire.
- Although different groups in Arania worship and give prayer to different subsets of gods, there are very few who outright deny their existence.
