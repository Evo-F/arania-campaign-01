## CONVEYANCE OF SENSITIVE MATERIAL

Major General Groff:

Concurrent with the delivery of this letter, you should also receive a separate, sealed document. This document is only openable by you, using the combination I provided to you at our last meeting.

Viewing of this document by anyone other than yourself is a crime punishable by execution without trial, for you as well as the perpetrator(s).

Long Live Cretias,

High General Arric
Steward of Cretias
