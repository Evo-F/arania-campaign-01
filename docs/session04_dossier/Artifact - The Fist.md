## DESCRIPTION
Artifact designation PD-001, or "The Fist", is a small crimson stone of unknown origin. The artifact is at all times warm to the touch. 

The artifact is to be contained at all times with **strict adherence** to the below-noted handling procedures. Failure to abide by appropriate handling procedures will result in execution. 

## BEHAVIOR
When not being actively wielded, the artifact passively absorbs latent energy from its surroundings, outputting it as detectable heat. This causes the stone to become warm. While in this state, the artifact has minimal noticeable effect on its surroundings; it may cause mild discomfort in non-sentient creatures within a roughly 5-foot radius. 

The artifact may be wielded by grasping it in hand, which results in an immediate attunement between the artifact and the wielder. This attunement persists as long as the wielder is in physical contact with the artifact. The wielder may then mentally direct the artifact to increase its energy absorption by any degree; at high levels, this can directly drain the life from the immediate area, causing plants, animals, and humanoids to weaken and wither. At the wielder's command, the artifact can release its stored energy in an immense thermal blast, the power of which is directly proportional to the energy absorbed. 

At higher levels, the blast emanating from the artifact may create what has been termed an **aura void** - a phenomenon which is believed to be a violent rip in the fabric of the Material Plane itself. This void acts like a drain on the latent energies and life forces of the area, attracting energy across vast distances and consuming it. This phenomenon has not been observed to absorb energy from sentient creatures; only plants and non-sentient animals. However, the planar disruption is known to cause significant sleep disturbances within the affected area.

At this time, there is no known method of permanent containment or neutralization for an aura void. Temporary containment methods have been devised, but is unknown how long such a method can last. 

## HISTORY
The artifact was first discovered in 159 5C, at which time it was designated SOC Confidential and placed under the express purview of the High General. The artifact was first tested in 173 5C (ref. file #95283). Since then, it has been under the careful supervision of the P\[REDACTED] D\[REDACTED] and used in various experiments and tests.
