## ASSESSMENT
- Maecia's primary allegiance is to her family and prioritizes their survival above everything. In this way, she is vulnerable to typical blackmail and extortion techniques.
	- These techniques have been employed in the past to great success, but have not been necessary for some time. 
- It is believed that Maecia's cartel can be leveraged indefinitely so long as she believes that her family is in danger. 
	- Although we do receive periodic intelligence reports from the southern reaches of Lampris, this intelligence is un-corroborated and often delayed. As a result, we do not know at any given moment the whereabouts of any Maecia family members, or even the whereabouts of Kedi herself. 
- It is our recommendation that additional resources be dedicated to fortifying our intelligence network in the southern region of Lampris in order to maintain timely reports and monitoring of the activites of the Maecia cartel.
