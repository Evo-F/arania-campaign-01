# INCIDENT REPORT

# SOC CONFIDENTIAL

- **Date of Incident:** May thru November 199 5C
- **Description:** Prolonged and violent civil unrest throughout the city of Kolir and surrounding towns. 
- **Overall Result:** Success

## RESULTS
- Unrest initiated following destruction of the home of a local populist leader by way of PD-001-A. 
- Throughout the following months, disorder perpetuated by periodic detonations of PD-001-A and acts of arson. 
- Unrest only ended with martial law declared and military reinforcement provided by House Cole. 

## ANALYSIS
- We believe that the local government in Kolir is sufficiently unstable that a fomented uprising could take root here with minimal effort. 
- It is our recommendation that we prioritize Kolir as a target for social manipulation and potentially establish an intelligence network there.
