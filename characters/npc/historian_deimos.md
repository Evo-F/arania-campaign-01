title: Historian Deimos
---
Historian Deimos (formerly Deimos Stormswift) is a Half-Elf scholar of The Grand Library. He has served in The Librarians' Guild for 31 years, and is considered the unofficial head of the History Wing. Deimos originally hails from the Cretian city of Al-Had.

Deimos entered the Guild as an Initiate at the age of 19. Originally, Deimos had intended to enlist in the Cretian National Guard at the age of 16, but he failed his physical fitness examination due to his frail stature. For the next three years, a despondent Deimos worked in the local civil service of Al-Had, continuing his studies in both history and military strategy. 

When he was 19, Deimos met an itinerant scholar from The Grand Library, who took an interest in Deimos and encouraged him to apply to enter the Guild. Deimos saved as much money as he could for the journey to Carrin, and upon arrival, passed his initiation exam with flying colors. 

Despite his rejection from the Cretian National Guard, Deimos fights with immense speed and efficiency. Although his fragile body limits the risks he can take in combat, he is still a formidable opponent, even in sparring matches with promising Initiates and Acolytes.
