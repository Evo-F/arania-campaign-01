title: Abel Peterson
---
Abel Peterson is the estranged father of Darach Abelson, a member of the Party. Abel currently resides in the village of Drayside on the Lamprian island of Hailoch; he has been there for the last five years in self-imposed exile.

Prior to his exile, Abel worked for the Cretian Military, eventually being recruited to the secret Phoenix Division to participate in covert weapons research. Abel served as the lead researcher for the Phoenix Division and oversaw research on the artifact known as [[dossier_44089|The Fist]]. Abel initially believed that his research would be used to advance civilian technology; however, upon learning that The Fist was instead to be used as a weapon, Abel became disillusioned and planned to escape.

Abel Peterson has been observed to be an aloof, eccentric, and emotionally distant man. Despite this, he claims to have gone into exile explicitly to protect his family.

# Encounters
The Party first encountered Abel in [[session11|Session 11]] when they arrived in Drayside following the liberation of Kolir.
