title: Primus
---
Primus is an automaton created by [[abel_peterson|Abel Peterson]]. Following his self-imposed exile, Abel traveled to the abandoned village of Drayside where he has resided for the last five years. During this time, Abel constructed many automatons to act as his servants and aides - Primus was the first automaton to be created, and Abel worked on Primus for some time before constructing other similar automatons.

Unlike his automaton siblings, Primus has the capability to experience basic emotions. It is unclear to both him and Abel where this capability came from. It is possible that Primus is special in some way, imbued with additional magical power that enables him to feel. It is also possible that Primus developed these emotions organically on account of his age, which makes it possible that other automatons would develop emotions in time. 

# Encounters
The Party first encountered Primus in [[session12|Session 12]]. Although not explicitly stated, it is assumed that Primus is Abel Peterson's primary aide and de facto second-in-command.
